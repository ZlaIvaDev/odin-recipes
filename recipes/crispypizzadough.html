        <h1>Crispy Pizza Dough</h1>
        <p>In order to make a nice crispy pizza, we have to learn how to make a dough  first!</p>
        <p>Even <strong>dough</strong> (<em>pun intended</em>) it seems complicated, it's actually very simple!</p>
        <p>So let's get started!</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <p>To make classic pizza dough we need few ingredients.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lukewarm water</li>
            <li>flour (00 or Strong)</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Yeast</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>Bloom the yeast</li>
            <p>in order to make the yeast bloom, we have to add <em>tsp</em> of sugar into <em>100ml</em> of lukewarm water.</p>
                <p>Next, we add yeast and stir for a few seconds.
                Afterwards, we let it rest and bloom (rise).</p>

            <li>Pour flour into the bowl,  add <em>tsp</em> of salt into it and mix them together.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Carefully add water into the bowl (3/4 of the cup),</p>
                <p>followed by <em>2 Tbsp's</em> of olive oil and start mixing the ingredients.</p>
                <p>You'll slowly add more water if necessary.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>After all the ingredients have been incorporated, get the mixture out of the bowl.</p>
                <p>Sprinkle a little bit of flour on the counter and place your dough on top of it.</p>
                <p>Now all you have to do is start kneading the dough with your hands,</p>
                <p>while occasionally sprinkling flour, until it stops sticking to your fingers.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Finally, put a little bit of olive oil in a container, add the dough into it, and seal it.</p>
                <p>For better results, let the dough rest in the fridge for 24 hours,</p>
                <p>but if you're in a rush, you can leave it in the kitchen for 3-4 hours.</p>
                <p>Remember, the longer it rests the better! Enjoy!</p>
